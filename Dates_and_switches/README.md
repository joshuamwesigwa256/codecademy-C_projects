# Dates and Switches
This is a classic coding project that utilizes switch statement 
logic to convert a given date into a familiar style displaying the
month, day, and year all written out.

## Forexample
Write a program that takes any user input in the format `mm/dd/yyyy`
and prints it out in the style **“January 1st, 2021.”** (derived in English
from whatever input is given).
