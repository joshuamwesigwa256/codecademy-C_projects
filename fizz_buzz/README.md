# Fizz_buzz

This programme prints numbers from `1-100` but with exeptions;
- Those that are multiples of 15, we use the *modulus(%)* to replace the 
number with fizzbuzz
- Those that are multiples of 3, we do the same but replace the printed
number with fizz.
- Finally those that are multples of 5, we replace the printed number 
with buzz.
