# Grocery Store Part 2
In this project, we are dealing with the receipt from a grocery after apple
sales, we have variables such as the `appleQuantity`, `applePrice`,
`appleReviewDisplay` and `reviewers`.

We also get to use `modulus(%)` to find out what sales we made on a particular
day of the week.
